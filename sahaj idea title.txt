Our aim is to develop a gamified platform on childrenâ€™s rights to increase legal literacy and awareness among children's in India. We empower children in India to better understand their rights and the laws that safeguard them. By providing an engaging, interactive, and inclusive platform, we aspire to create a more aware and legally informed generation of young citizens who can advocate for their rights and contribute positively to society. This project holds the promise of a brighter, more equitable future for children across India. Our  platform will be multilingual and have a community page to help the children collaborate with each other and legal experts. Platform will be accessible for all children aged 8-16 years ,there will be illustrations based on real-life examples with the help of games or quizzes. Our platform will collaborate with various Child Rights Organizations and Educational Institutes.
